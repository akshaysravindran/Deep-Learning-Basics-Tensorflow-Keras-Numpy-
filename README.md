# Deep-Learning-Basics-Tensorflow-Keras-Numpy-


This repo contains some of the earliest codes/ tutorials I used to learn different implementations of neural networks. Many of these came from the introduction to Deep Learning Course at the Rice Univeristy, Introduction to Machine Learning Course at the University of Houston. There exist code implementing neural network from scratch in numpy with decision boundary visualisation and simple implementations of different deep learning architectures. 

## This repository is not maintained/updated and is based on tensorflow version in 2018, therefore some code might run into issues.  Tensorflow no longer contains the module 'tensorflow.examples.tutorial
